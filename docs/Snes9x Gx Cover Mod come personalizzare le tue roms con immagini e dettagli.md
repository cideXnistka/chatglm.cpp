## Step 2: Extract and Copy the Files
 
Once you have downloaded the package, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will see two folders: Essentials and Standalone. The Essentials folder contains the full pack of content, while the Standalone folder contains individual parts of the pack.
 
You need to copy the snes9xgx folder from the Essentials/apps/snes9xgx folder and paste it into your SD card or USB device/apps folder. This is where the emulator will be located.
 
You also need to copy the snes9xgx folder that contains the cheats/covers/roms/saves folders and paste it into the root of your SD card or USB device. This is where your roms and covers will be stored.
 
Finally, you need to extract the roms to the root/snes9xgx/roms folder. You can choose which roms you want to copy, but make sure they have the same name as their corresponding covers.
 
## Step 3: Launch Snes9x Gx Cover Mod
 
Now that you have copied all the files, you can launch Snes9x Gx Cover Mod from the Homebrew Channel on your Wii. You will see a scrolling cover view of your roms. You can use the D-pad or the Wiimote pointer to navigate through them. You can also press A to select a rom or B to go back.
 
If you want to change the cover style, you can press 1 on your Wiimote and choose from 2D, 3D, 2D cartridge, 3D cartridge, or screenshots. You can also press 2 on your Wiimote and click on the game title to view game details, such as genre, players, author, year, and plot. These details are based on a info.xml file that is located in the root/snes9xgx folder.
 
## Step 4: Play Your SNES Games
 
Once you have selected a rom, you can press A again to start playing. You can use any compatible controller, such as a Wiimote, a Classic Controller, or a GameCube Controller. You can also press Home on your Wiimote to access a menu where you can save or load states, change settings, or exit the game.
 
If you want to use cheat codes, you can press Z on your Classic Controller or GameCube Controller or C on your Nunchuk to access a cheat menu. You can enable or disable cheats for each game. The cheat files are located in the root/snes9xgx/cheats folder.
