## Faster and More Flexible 3D Modeling
 
Solid Edge ST7 enables you to design better products and get them to market ahead of your competitors with faster and more flexible 3D part and assembly modeling. You can use 3D Sketch to rapidly define 3D paths for sweep operations, model pipes and wires that are bent in more than one plane, and design hose type components that have a specific length. You can also take advantage of the expanded use of synchronous technology to speed up design tasks and improve re-use of imported data. Synchronous technology allows you to edit geometry directly without worrying about the feature history or constraints. You can also recognize chamfers, patterns of patterns, and offset surfaces with synchronous technology.
 
## Photorealistic Rendering
 
Solid Edge ST7 includes a tightly integrated rendering capability that allows you to create amazing photorealistic images of your products. The solution uses KeyShotÂ®, the fastest and easiest way to create beautiful product images. You can render while you design, as any changes to the model are automatically updated in the rendered image using the "Live Link" feature. You can also choose from a variety of materials, environments, lighting options, and camera settings to create stunning visuals for your presentations, marketing materials, or web pages.
 
## Visual Design Management
 
Solid Edge ST7 helps you complete projects faster and more efficiently with enhanced visual design management capabilities. You can use Solid Edge Insightâ¢ to manage your design data in MicrosoftÂ® SharePointÂ®, a widely used collaboration platform. Insight provides secure access control, revision management, workflow support, and search capabilities for your design data. You can also use Solid Edge Design Manager to perform common data management tasks such as copy, rename, replace, or revise directly from within Solid Edge. Design Manager also supports integration with other data management systems such as TeamcenterÂ®.
