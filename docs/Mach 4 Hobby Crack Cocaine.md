Mach4-Hobby is not designed for a specific motion control device and will need a plugin and motion control board to operate a CNC system. Currently, Vital Systems and PMDX have pluginâs available for motion control[^1^]. You can also use the parallel port legacy plugin if you require a system run from the parallel port[^1^]. Mach4-Hobby supports up to 6 axis machines and can operate various types of machines, such as mills, drills, lathes, routers, tangential knife, plasma, laser, and 3D printers[^5^].
 
Mach4-Hobby is not only a powerful software for CNC control, but also a platform for expansion, modification, and new features. You can customize the user interface with tab controls, buttons, graphics, and indicators. You can also write your own plugins and scripts to extend the functionality of Mach4-Hobby[^5^]. Mach4-Hobby is constantly being updated and improved by Newfangled Solutions and the CNC community.

One of the benefits of Mach4-Hobby is that it can control CNC machinery, PLC equipment, and robotics. The core of Mach4-Hobby is a full featured âbrainâ that ensures all input and output devices are coordinated with motion. All motion control calculations are done in the core, which reduces the dependence on hardware and associated software drivers[^2^]. This means that Mach4-Hobby can handle complex and dynamic CNC projects with ease and precision.
 
Another benefit of Mach4-Hobby is that it can run on a wide range of hardware devices. You can use a dedicated motion control board, such as the WixHC Mach4 controller, which supports up to 6 axis functionality and offers up to 2000KHz step pulse frequency[^3^]. You can also use an Ethernet or USB connection to communicate with your CNC machine. Mach4-Hobby is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 operating systems[^2^]. You can even use a touch screen monitor to interact with Mach4-Hobby's user interface.
 
A third benefit of Mach4-Hobby is that it has a large and active community of users and developers. You can find support, tutorials, plugins, scripts, and other resources on the Newfangled Solutions website and forum[^2^]. You can also share your feedback, suggestions, and ideas with other Mach4-Hobby users and learn from their experiences. Mach4-Hobby is constantly being updated and improved by Newfangled Solutions and the CNC community.
