## Four Layers of Synthesis
  
One of the main advantages of Tone 5.ElectraX.VSTi.v1.2-prplxr is that it allows you to combine up to four different layers of synthesis in one plugin. Each layer can have its own oscillator, filter, envelope, LFO, arpeggiator, effects, and modulation matrix. This means you can create complex and rich sounds by mixing and matching different types of synthesis and effects.
  
For example, you can use a layer of wavetable synthesis to create a metallic or digital sound, a layer of FM synthesis to add some harmonic richness or distortion, a layer of analog synthesis to add some warmth or fatness, and a layer of sample playback to add some realism or texture. You can also adjust the volume, pan, detune, and phase of each layer to create interesting stereo effects or movement.
  
## 14 Types of Synthesis
  
Another advantage of Tone 5.ElectraX.VSTi.v1.2-prplxr is that it offers 14 different types of synthesis to choose from. Each type has its own unique characteristics and possibilities. Here are some of the types available:

- Wavetable: This type uses a series of waveforms that can be scanned or morphed to create dynamic and evolving sounds.
- FM: This type uses frequency modulation to create complex and expressive sounds that can range from bell-like to harsh and noisy.
- Analog: This type emulates the classic subtractive synthesis of analog synthesizers, which can produce warm and fat sounds with filters and envelopes.
- Physical Modeling: This type simulates the physical properties of acoustic instruments, such as strings, wind, or percussion.
- Vocoder: This type uses a carrier signal and a modulator signal to create robotic or vocal-like sounds.

These are just some examples of the types of synthesis available in Tone 5.ElectraX.VSTi.v1.2-prplxr. You can also find other types such as additive, phase distortion, sync, noise, fractal, pluck, ultra-saw, and more.
