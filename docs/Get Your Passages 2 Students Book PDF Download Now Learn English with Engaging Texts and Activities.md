One of the features of Passages 2 Student's Book is the use of thematic vocabulary and collocations that help students expand their lexical range and express themselves more accurately and fluently. Each unit introduces a set of words and phrases related to the theme and topic of the unit, and provides opportunities for students to practice them in various contexts. For example, in Unit 1, which is about social media and popular culture, students learn vocabulary such as **post**, **share**, **like**, **follow**, **trend**, **go viral**, and **influencer**. The book also includes a glossary with definitions and examples of all the vocabulary items presented in the units.
 
Another feature of Passages 2 Student's Book is the focus on grammar and accuracy. Each unit contains a grammar presentation and practice section that covers a specific grammar point or structure that is relevant to the level and the theme of the unit. The grammar points are explained in clear and simple language, with examples and charts that illustrate their form and use. The practice activities are designed to help students apply the grammar rules in meaningful and communicative ways. For example, in Unit 2, which is about travel and tourism, students learn how to use modal verbs to express possibility, ability, permission, advice, and obligation. The book also includes a grammar reference section with more detailed explanations and examples of all the grammar points covered in the units.
 
A third feature of Passages 2 Student's Book is the emphasis on skills development and integration. Each unit contains four skills lessons that focus on listening, speaking, reading, or writing. The skills lessons are based on authentic texts and audio materials that expose students to a variety of genres, styles, registers, and accents. The skills lessons also include tasks and projects that require students to use different skills and language areas in an integrated way. For example, in Unit 3, which is about health and wellness, students listen to a podcast about meditation, read an article about happiness, write an email to a friend with advice on how to cope with stress, and give a presentation about their own wellness plan. The book also includes a self-study section with additional practice activities for each skill.
