In this article, we will break down Canon Rock into four main sections: the intro, the verse, the chorus, and the solo. We will explain how to play each section and give you some tips and tricks to make it easier and more fun.
 
## The Intro
 
The intro of Canon Rock is based on the original Canon in D melody, but with some added embellishments and variations. It starts with a clean guitar tone and a simple arpeggio pattern over the D-A-Bm-F#m-G-D-G-A chord progression. The arpeggio pattern consists of four notes per chord, played with alternate picking. You can use your index finger to barre the first three strings and your ring finger to play the fourth string.
 
After playing the arpeggio pattern twice, you switch to a distorted guitar tone and add some hammer-ons and pull-offs to the melody. You also change the chord progression to D-A-Bm-F#m-G-D-Em-A. The hammer-ons and pull-offs are played with your index and pinky fingers on the first string, while your middle finger plays the second string. You can use your palm to mute the lower strings and avoid unwanted noise.

The intro ends with a slide from the 17th fret to the 22nd fret on the first string, followed by a bend and release on the same fret. You can use your ring finger to slide and bend, supported by your index and middle fingers. You can also add some vibrato to the last note for more expression.
 
## The Verse
 
The verse of Canon Rock is a fast and furious section that showcases your picking skills. It consists of 16th note triplets played over the same chord progression as the intro, but with different notes and rhythms. You can use alternate picking or economy picking for this section, depending on your preference. Economy picking means that you use the same direction of your pick when changing strings, which can save you some motion and time.
 
The verse starts with a descending run on the first string, followed by a series of ascending and descending runs on different strings. You can use your index finger to play most of the notes on the first string, except for the ones on the 22nd fret, which you can play with your pinky finger. You can also use your index finger to barre some notes on adjacent strings when possible.
 
The verse ends with a tapping lick that involves tapping the 22nd fret on the first string with your right hand index finger, while pulling off to the 17th fret and hammering on to the 19th fret with your left hand fingers. You can repeat this lick four times, then slide down to the 12th fret and tap it once before moving on to the chorus.
 
## The Chorus
 
The chorus of Canon Rock is a melodic and catchy section that follows the original Canon in D melody more closely. It uses a combination of bends, slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and harmonics to create a rich and expressive sound. You can use your index finger to play most of the notes on the first string, except for the ones on higher frets, which you can play with your ring or pinky fingers.
 
The chorus starts with a bend on the 15th fret of the second string, followed by a slide to the 17th fret on the same string. You then play a series of notes on the first string that match the Canon in D melody. You can add some harmonics on some notes by lightly touching the string above certain frets (such as 5th, 7th, or 12th) while picking it. Harmonics produce a high-pitched ringing sound that adds some sparkle to your tone.
 
The chorus ends with a slide from the 17th fret to the 22nd fret on the first string, followed by another bend and release on the same fret. You can also add some vibrato to the last note for more expression.
 
## The Solo
 
The solo of Canon Rock is arguably the most difficult and impressive part of the song. It features a variety of techniques such as sweep picking, legato, tapping, tremolo picking, whammy bar tricks, and more. It also requires a lot of speed, accuracy, and stamina to play it well. You will need to practice each part slowly and gradually increase your speed until you can play it smoothly and confidently.
 
The solo starts with a sweep picking lick that involves playing five notes per chord in an
