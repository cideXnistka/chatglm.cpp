One of the best newsreaders available is News File Grabber, a powerful and high efficient Usenet software that lets you easily download all kinds of files from the USENET Newsgroups. It also supports NZB files, which are files that contain information about what you want to download from Usenet.

The current version of News File Grabber is 4.6.0.4, which works with Windows 98/ME/NT4/2000/XP/Vista/7 (32/64 bit). However, this version is not free, and you need to pay for a license to use it.
 
If you want to use News File Grabber for free, you may be tempted to look for a cracked version online. A cracked version is a modified version of the software that bypasses the license verification and allows you to use it without paying.
 
However, downloading a cracked version of News File Grabber 4.6.0.4 is not recommended, as it may come with several risks and disadvantages, such as:

- You may download a fake or malicious file that contains viruses, malware, spyware or ransomware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.
- You may violate the intellectual property rights of the software developer and face legal consequences.
- You may not get the latest updates, bug fixes or security patches for the software.
- You may not get any technical support or customer service from the software developer.
- You may experience errors, crashes or performance issues with the software.

Therefore, it is better to avoid downloading a cracked version of News File Grabber 4.6.0.4 and instead purchase a legitimate license from the official website: [https://rsbr.de/Software/nfg/index.htm](https://rsbr.de/Software/nfg/index.htm)
