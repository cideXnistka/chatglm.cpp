Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory is a free multiplayer first-person shooter game that was released in 2003. The game is set during World War II and features two teams, the Allies and the Axis, fighting for objectives in various maps. The game is still popular among fans of the genre, but some players may want to have an edge over their opponents by using cheats such as aimbots and wallhacks.
 
An aimbot is a cheat that automatically aims at enemies and shoots them for you, while a wallhack is a cheat that allows you to see through walls and other obstacles. These cheats can give you a huge advantage in the game, but they can also get you banned by PunkBuster, the anti-cheat system used by Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. Therefore, you need to be careful when downloading and using these cheats.

This mod allows you to play the game with cheats such as aimbot, wallhack, speedhack, and more. The best part is that this mod automatically downloads for the client and requires the server to be running the mod. This means that you can only cheat on a server running HackerMod and you will never be banned by PunkBuster for using cheats.
 
To download HackerMod, go to [^1^] and click on the "Download Now" button. You will get a zip file called hackermod.zip that contains the mod files. Extract the zip file to your Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory folder (usually located at C:\Program Files\Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory).
 
## Step 2: Run the Aimbot
 
The next step is to run the aimbot and join a server running HackerMod. To do this, launch Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and go to Mods. Select HackerMod from the list and click on Load Mod. You will see a message saying "HackerMod Loaded Successfully".
 
Now, go to Play Online and look for servers that have HackerMod in their name or description. Join one of these servers and start playing. You will notice that you have a new menu called HackerMod Settings in your Options menu. This menu allows you to configure the cheat settings such as aimbot, wallhack, speedhack, etc.
 
## Step 3: Configure the Aimbot
 
The final step is to configure the aimbot to your liking. To do this, go to Options > HackerMod Settings > Aimbot Settings. You will see a list of options that you can toggle on or off using your mouse or keyboard.
 
Some of the options are:
 
- Aimbot On/Off: This option enables or disables the aimbot.
- Aim Mode: This option determines how the aimbot aims at enemies. You can choose between Auto Aim (the aimbot automatically aims and shoots at enemies), Auto Shoot (the aimbot automatically shoots at enemies but you have to aim manually), or Manual (the aimbot only works when you press a key).
- Aim Key: This option sets the key that activates the aimbot when using Manual mode. You can choose any key from your keyboard.
- Aim Bone: This option sets the body part that the aimbot aims at. You can choose between Head (the aimbot aims at the head of enemies), Chest (the aimbot aims at the chest of enemies), or Random (the aimbot aims at a random body part of enemies).
