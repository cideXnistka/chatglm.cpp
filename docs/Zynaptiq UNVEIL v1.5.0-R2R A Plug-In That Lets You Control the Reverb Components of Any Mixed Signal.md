## Step 3: Adjust the Focus and Reverb Reduction Parameters
 
The Focus and Reverb Reduction parameters are the core of Zynaptiq UNVEIL v1.5.0-R2R's functionality.

A negative value will attenuate perceptionally less important signal components, such as noise, ambience, or room modes, making the sound more focused and clear. A positive value will boost these components, making the sound more diffuse and spacious.
