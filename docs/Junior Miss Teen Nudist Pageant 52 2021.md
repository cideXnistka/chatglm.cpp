But he bounced back at the Deposit Guaranty Classic in Madison, Miss., last week, where he showed his skills and confidence on the greens. He said he was very nervous before he made a 30-foot birdie putt on the 13th hole, but that shot calmed him down and helped him secure his fifth Tour title and $216,000 in prize money.

Funk, who had been wearing glasses since he was 10 years old, decided to have laser eye surgery in May to correct his nearsightedness. He said he was tired of dealing with contacts and glasses on the course, and he hoped the surgery would improve his vision and his game. He was cleared to play two weeks after the procedure, but he struggled to adjust to his new eyesight. He missed the cut at the Memorial Tournament and then squandered a three-shot lead at the Kemper Open, where he shot a 75 on Sunday and finished in a tie for sixth.
  
He admitted that he was doubting himself and his decision to have the surgery, but he did not give up. He practiced hard and tried to regain his confidence. He said he felt more comfortable at the Deposit Guaranty Classic, where he had won in 1998 and 1999. He played consistently throughout the week, shooting 67-68-67-66 for a 20-under-par total of 268. He had a one-shot lead over Harrison Frazar going into the final round, but he faced some pressure from Frazar and David Toms, who were both chasing their first Tour wins.
  
The turning point came on the 13th hole, a par-four with water on the left and a bunker on the right. Funk hit a perfect drive and then a nine-iron to 30 feet from the hole. He said he was very nervous before he took the putt, but he managed to sink it for a birdie. That gave him a two-shot cushion over Frazar and Toms, who both made pars on that hole. Funk said he relaxed after that putt and felt more confident. He made two more birdies on the 15th and 16th holes, and finished with a four-shot victory over Frazar, who shot a 69. Toms finished third with a 68.
