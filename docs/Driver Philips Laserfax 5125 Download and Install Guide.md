` `
## Step 1: Find your product model number and slash code
` `
The first thing you need to do is to find your product model number and slash code. These are usually printed on a sticker at the back or bottom of your fax machine. For example, LPF5125/GBB. You will need these numbers to search for the right driver for your product.
` `
## Step 2: Visit the Philips Software & Drivers page
` `
Next, you need to visit the Philips Software & Drivers page at [https://www.usa.philips.com/c-w/support-home/support-software-and-drivers.html](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-w/support-home/support-software-and-drivers.html). This is where you can find the latest software updates for your Philips products.
` `
## Step 3: Search for your product using the model number and slash code
` `
On the Philips Software & Drivers page, you can search for your product using the model number and slash code that you found in step 1. For example, LPF5125/GBB. Type it in the search field and click on the magnifying glass icon. The support page for your product should be the first result.
` `
## Step 4: Compare the software version of your product with the one offered on the support page
` `
On the support page for your product, you can find the software version that is available for download. Compare it with the software version that is already installed on your fax machine. You can find the current software version on your fax machine by selecting âMenuâ > âSetupâ > âSoftwareâ > âCurrent softwareâ. If a newer version is available on the support page, you can proceed to download it. If not, you already have the latest software and you do not need to update it.
` `
## Step 5: Download and unzip the software file
` `
If a newer software version is available on the support page, click on the download button and save the file to your computer. The software file is usually a compressed zip file, which means you need to use special software to unzip it. You can use Winzip or WinRar for this purpose. After unzipping the file, you should see a folder with several files inside.
