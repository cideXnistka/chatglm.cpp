One option is to use the free trial version of SolidWorks. You can sign up for a 30-day trial on the official website[^1^] and access all the features and functionalities of SolidWorks. However, you will need a valid email address and some personal information to register for the trial. You will also need a compatible device and internet connection to run SolidWorks online.
 
Another option is to use the free student version of SolidWorks. If you are enrolled in an academic institution that has a SolidWorks license, you can request a student license from your instructor or IT department. You can also apply for a student license directly from SolidWorks if you meet the eligibility criteria[^2^]. The student version of SolidWorks has some limitations, such as a watermark on the output and an expiration date after 12 months.

You will need to submit an application and agree to some terms and conditions to join the program.
 
As you can see, there are some ways to download SolidWorks free full version, but they all have some restrictions and requirements. If you want to use SolidWorks without any limitations, you will have to purchase a license from an authorized reseller or directly from SolidWorks. The price of SolidWorks depends on the edition, the features, and the subscription plan that you choose. You can contact SolidWorks for a quote or check their website for more information.
  
Why should you use SolidWorks for your 3D CAD design? Here are some of the benefits and features of SolidWorks that make it a popular choice among engineers, designers, and makers.
 
- **Simple but sophisticated 3D CAD design**: SolidWorks lets you create complex 3D models with ease and accuracy. You can use parametric modeling, direct editing, and freeform modeling tools to create any shape you can imagine. You can also use templates and the CAD library for improved efficiency[^1^].
- **Automation and design reuse**: SolidWorks helps you speed up the design process by automating repetitive tasks and reusing existing data. You can use features such as design tables, configurations, equations, and macros to create multiple variations of a model with minimal effort. You can also leverage your previous designs or import data from other sources to save time and avoid errors[^1^].
- **Cost estimation tools**: SolidWorks allows you to keep track of the cost of your design in real-time. You can use the built-in cost estimation tool or integrate with third-party applications to estimate the material, manufacturing, and labor costs of your design. You can also compare different design scenarios and optimize your design for cost and performance[^1^].
- **Interference check**: SolidWorks helps you ensure potential risks are caught early with interference check. You can use this feature to detect any collisions or interferences between parts or assemblies in your design. You can also use clearance verification and dynamic collision detection to avoid any unwanted contact or movement between components[^1^].
- **2D drawings for production**: SolidWorks enables you to quickly produce 2D drawings for production from your 3D models. You can use the automated drawing tools to generate views, dimensions, annotations, and bills of materials. You can also customize your drawing standards and templates to meet your specific requirements[^1^].
- **Animations and photorealistic renderings**: SolidWorks allows you to easily create animations and photorealistic renderings of your design. You can use the motion study tool to simulate the motion and behavior of your design. You can also use the visualize tool to create stunning images and videos of your design with realistic lighting, materials, and environments[^1^].
- **Expanded interoperability with 3D Interconnect**: SolidWorks lets you collaborate with more data sources easily. You can use the 3D Interconnect feature to work with native files from other CAD systems without converting them. You can also drag and drop non-native SOLIDWORKS files into an active part or assembly. SolidWorks supports new file types such as BREP data from DXF/DWG files and IFC files[^2^].
- **Improved design experience**: SolidWorks saves you time and simplifies your design tasks with various enhancements. You can access an extensive list of commercially available 3D printer volumes and create slices for 3D printing directly from SOLIDWORKS geometry. You can also offset surfaces without identifying faces that cannot be offset, and specify more types of surface direction vectors for thickening[^2^].
- **Connected design-to-manufacturing ecosystem in the cloud**: SolidWorks enables you to extend your design capabilities by connecting to the cloud-based 3DEXPERIENCE platform. You can access key tools such as subdivision modeling, conceptual design, product lifecycle management, project management, advanced simulation, manufacturing, and production in the cloud. You can also share models back and forth between SOLIDWORKS and 3DEXPERIENCE tools, and collaborate in real time from anywhere and on any device[^2^].

As you can see, SolidWorks offers a range of benefits and features that can help you design better products faster and easier. If you want to learn more about SolidWorks or download a free trial version, visit their official website[^1^] or contact their authorized resellers.
